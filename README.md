# Week 6 Homework

Your assignment for this week is to build a __Channel Changer Application__.  You will create an application containing multiple "channel" buttons that when clicked, displays a random video from that channel.

The number and type of channels is entirely up to you.

For example, your channels could be "UFOs", "Eating Competitions" and "Vintage Screensavers".

### Requirements
- Each channel in your data object must contain a `title` property and a `videoIds` property that contains an array of video IDs.  Please include at least _three_ videos for each channel.
- Use JavaScript to render a button for each channel.  The text inside the button should be the title of the channel.
- Clicking a channel button should load a random video from the selected channel into an iframe embed inside the `#tv` element.  This element starts empty, you must create the iframe and add it to the page.
- Please restyle the elements on this page.  I don't care what it looks like, just as long as it's not black / white / Helvetica in the end. Use the HTML structure that I've provided to start. Feel free to add additional elements if you need them for design or layout purposes.
